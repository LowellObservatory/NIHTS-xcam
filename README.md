*xenics_pluto* - 
===============================================================================================================

This package contains a stripped down version of Henry Roe's Xenics XEVA near-infrared software for Pluto occultation observations.

Installation
============

This version of xenics software expects a copy of Enthought's Canopy python installation to be installed and available as the default python (or at least be the default python in the terminal session from which you want to run xenics.)

To compile the shared object file requires that Xcode and its command line tools be installed.
